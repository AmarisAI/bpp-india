Product Prices analysis for various online retail stores ( Amazon,Flipkart,Snapdeal,HomeShop18 etc.)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Billion Prices Project is an initiative by two MIT profs to compute inflation statistics from online prices of goods instead of physical sampling as done by BLS. We are replicating the same for India.

Using the same category of products that RBI uses, we mine various online stores for prices of goods on a daily basis.
We generate category indices for each category of products using appropriate weighting and then create a final inflation index.
